# surro_1: frontend

laser spot, SOL1, CQ01, SQ01

measures spot on screen

Need practical ranges for SOL1

laser spot: 0.8, 1.0 1.2 mm 

charge is different for these. 

Measured at YAG2


# surro_2

Use Bmad?

Fixed frontend

L0A, B phases scanned

Feeback on/off for amplitudes

screens at several places. scalars and image data


# Open questions

dipole correctors?

misalignment study 

emittance at OTR2 is the most important thing.
